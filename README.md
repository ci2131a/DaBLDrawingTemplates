Adaptable computer aided design (CAD) files for use as design drawing templates.

## Overview

The Design and Build Lab (DaBL) is a rapid prototyping space that specializes in digital fabrication. Its goal is to teach students, staff, and faculty how to create things to solve problems. One of the most powerful tools of the space is CAD. It is very useful for creating digital objects that can be sent to a machine for manufacturing. As such, the space regularly teaches workshops that demonstrate how to use programs designed for CAD such as Fusion 360, Eagle, etc. 
One important feature in reproducability is proper documentation. Addititionally, it can be used to showcase ones work. As such, we seek to teach members to create proper design drawing for such purposes. 


## Purpose

This repository serves to provide relevant template files to be used in CAD drawings. Template files are currently limited to the following programs :
	
- [Fusion 360](Fusion360/README.md) for three-dimensional design.


Additionally, title block files can be found in the respective folder for other programs.
